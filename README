WrapSix with TUN
================

This is a WrapSix fork which uses TUN device instead of sniffing raw socket. The
benefit of approach is cleaner solution without "hidden" IP address and simpler
implementation (no ARP handling etc.).
Also the permonace could be better in some cases as only packets which should be
translated are copied to the userspace. Though no measurements was performed.

How it works
------------

When IPv6 packet with destination address from NAT64 network is received it is
routed by operating system to the tun device. WrapSix reads the packet from the
device, translates it to IPv4 and writes the result it back to the tun adapter.
Operating system then routes the packet to destionation network. The way back
works exactly the same.

About
-----
WrapSix is a fast NAT64 implementation. You also need a DNS64 server (e.g., BIND
or unbound).

Installation
------------
For installation use standard ./configure && make && make install commands.

Configuration
-------------
WrapSix uses configuration file wrapsix.conf from configuration directory set in
"./configure" phase, which is by default /usr/local/etc. You can also specify
custom configuration file in runtime -- just pass its path as an argument:

# wrapsix ./wrapsix.conf

Pay attention to the IPv4 address. If you assign IP address that is already
controlled by your OS, TCP won't work (OS will terminate all connection
attempts).

Also, IPv4 is a little bit tricky. To ease both configuration and implementation
as much as possible, WrapSix leverages configuration for IPv4 already present in
the operating system. Therefore to work, IPv4 needs to be functional on the OS
level.

Running
-------
It can be run by `wrapsix` command as root.

Please note that traffic originating from the host WrapSix runs on cannot be
translated since WrapSix listens for incoming packets on the interface itself.
Therefore, you need some other host for testing it. If WrapSix doesn't seem to
be working, ensure (e.g., with tcpdump) that you have correctly configured
routing in your network.
